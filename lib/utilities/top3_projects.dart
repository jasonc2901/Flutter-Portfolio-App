    "description": "his is a script I created to challenge myself using Python. Iâ€™ve been using this language a lot in my current job and been fascinated with the huge number of things I can create with it. This project is essentially a script that monitors a specific folder on my laptop for any changes, when a file is placed into this folder the script will check the file type by looking at the extension and determine which sub folder it should be placed into. This was a project I came up with myself and created the code from scratch. I have linked my GitHub account if you want to download this project and use it on your own devices.",

    "title": "JavaScript Angry Birds Clone",
    "description": "This project was a One day build designed to copy similar physics methods found within the popular game 'Angry Birds'. I created this using a combination of the P5 JavaScript library and the Matter.js physics engine. This is a very basic attempt at recreating some core functionality from the original game and could definitely be improved. This was simply a small project I done to experiment with different JavaScript libraries.",

    "title": "Login System",
    "description": "This project was simply created by myself in order to try something new. What I created was a Login system that validated user login data stored in a local database. If the user details where successfully validated the program will send the user to the next screen, this screen has features I made such as a calculator. I achieved all of this using Java and its built in JFrame features within the Netbeans IDE. You can download this project below to get a better idea of what I have created.",
