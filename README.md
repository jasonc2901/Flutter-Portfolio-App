# My portfolio App

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is my first real experience with creating an app with Flutter. I tried to essentially turn my website "www.jasoncaughers.com" into a mobile app for both IOS and Android Platforms. 

The main purpose with this app was to gain key skills using flutter so I will be able to use this framework going forward in my career.
