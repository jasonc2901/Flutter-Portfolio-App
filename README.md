# My portfolio App

This project was intended to simply convert my existing portfolio website www.jasoncaughers.com into a multi-platform mobile application that works on both Android and IOS devices.

The main objective with this project was to simply become more skilled at using the Flutter framework and writing code using the Dart programming language, I feel that this app turned out great for a first version and I intend on getting this added to the Google Play Store as well as Apple App Store when I have added a number of new features and improvements. 

## Getting Started

To run this app simply either connect your Android or IOS Device to your computer (ensuring App Debugging/Developer options have been enabled) or run an emulator. Navigate to the project directory and simply run the following command to compile and launch the application on your desired device.

- flutter run
